* Motivation

Honestly, cause it was more fun than my real work.  After working on several product though my career I found myself hating building CRUD APIs (Create, Update, Delete, List, Show). It was always the same thing figure out what the UI needs then build an endpoint for it, if related data is needed than join with another table. I didn't want to write that code anymore I wanted the computer to just do it.
